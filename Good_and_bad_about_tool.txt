problems with Tool:
1. have to pay for every little thing
2. doesnt properly do statblocks for summons or subclass pets
3. its not "spell concentration" friendly (there is literally no way to track concentration)
4. you cant track AC changes that come from spells
5. the search engine for anything is shit
6. only works if u have internet / cant acces rulings in your own machine
7. bad homewbrew adaptation
8. can only have 6 characters at a time unless you pay for a subscription
9. there is no support for vtt (there is a need to install a 3rd party program)

good things with Tool:
1. everything is one place so you only "need" one tab
2. character sheet customization (background, colours, pfp, pfp border idk what else)
3. can have multiple characters
4. its new player friendly (there is no need to learn every ruling)
